gentoo-overlay
==============

My gentoo overlay. 

I proxy a couple of packages and it's probably easier
to maintain patch queues through git. So here we go.

Branch process:
1. Import ebuild into master (xapian branch is a good example of _not_ doing this)
2. Create version bump branch
3. Do changes
4. File bug at bugzilla/ping proxy maintainer, point to merge/branch diff.
5. When merged into gentoo-x86 (or other official overlay), check diffs and commit back to branch
6. Merge branch to master

Stuff to think about:
- Put Manifest in gitignore?
